# ARuLearning

**ARuLearning** is a web application designed for mobile devices to help students learn anatomy through Augmented Reality (AR). The app leverages AR.js and A-Frame for seamless, interactive AR experiences.

## Features

- **Interactive Anatomy Lessons**: Visualize and explore 3D anatomical models in AR.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for mobile devices to provide an accessible learning experience.
- **Real-Time AR Interaction**: Use your device's camera to interact with 3D models of human anatomy in the real world.

## Technologies Used

- **AR.js**: A powerful JavaScript library that enables AR experiences in web browsers. We use AR.js to track markers and overlay 3D anatomy models in the real world.
- **A-Frame**: A web framework for building virtual reality (VR) and AR experiences. A-Frame integrates seamlessly with AR.js, allowing us to build immersive 3D environments and models that can be viewed in AR.

## Known Issues

- **AR.js**:  
  - On devices with multiple cameras, Chrome may have trouble detecting the correct camera for AR experiences. If this issue occurs, we recommend using **Firefox** as an alternative browser. There is an open issue for this behavior.
