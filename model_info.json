    "Skeleton": "The human skeleton is a remarkable internal framework that forms the structural foundation of the body. Composed of approximately 206 bones in adults, it serves several crucial functions. The skeleton provides support and shape to the body, enabling us to maintain an upright posture and facilitating movement by serving as attachment points for muscles. It also plays a vital role in protecting internal organs, such as the brain, heart, and lungs, from external impacts and injuries. Beyond its structural and protective roles, the skeleton is essential for blood cell production, which occurs in the bone marrow of certain bones. Additionally, it acts as a storage system for important minerals like calcium and phosphorus, which can be released into the bloodstream as needed. Together, these functions make the skeletal system indispensable for human life and overall health."
